        <h1>HI! I'm Omi!</h1>
        <p>Iâ€™m a passionate UX/UI designer with a strong drive to create memorable and enjoyable user experiences. My journey in the realm of design starts with my fascination for understanding         human behavoir, as well as a commitment to crafting intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and functional interfaces.  

          Design, for me, is a perfect blend of art and psychology. My design philosophy centers around empathy, as I believe that it takes truly understanding the users, and their needs and pain points in order to create a delightful and profound user experience.</p>
